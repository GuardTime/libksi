Building with Microsoft Visual Studio
=====================================

	This document describes how to build KSI C API as static and dynamic library
	using Microsoft Visual Studio tools and different libraries.
	
	
Prerequisites
=====================================

	To be able to build GT KSI API one must have the following software pieces:

		1) Microsoft Visual Studio 10 or Windows SDK 7.1 for building tools.
		2) Network provider (must have one)
			2.1) Lib Curl 0.9.8g (recommended).
			2.2) Windows native WinINet
			2.4) Windows native WinHTTP 
		3) Cryptography provider (must have one)
			3.1) OpenSSL 0.9.8g (recommended)
			3.2) Windows native CryptoAPI
		
	Lib Curl must be build from binaries when Visual Studio 14 and lib Curl are 
	used for building API:
		1) Download cURL 7.37 binaries from git.
		2) Build cURL using Visual Studio Command prompt and the following command
			in cURL winbuild directory:
			nmake /f MakeFile.vc mode=static VC=12 MACHINE=x86
		3) Find out what kind of RTL was used from bulding logs.
		4) Rename libcurl_a.lib to correct name depending on which RTL
			was used (e.g. rename to libcurlMD.lib if MD was used).
		5) Install cURL:
			5.1) move build to desired location and rename the directory
			5.2) Copy curl.exe from bin folder to system32
			5.3) Add curl path to system variables
	
	When KSI API uses OpenSSl or Curl the location of libraries must be specified.
	See make file options CURL_DIR, OPENSSL_DIR. The structure of the directories
	must be as described below. The name of static library or import library files
	must contain description of C runtime library (RTL). After build, rename 
	libcurl(RTL).dll as libcurl.dll and libeay32(RTL).dll as libeay32.dll. Windows
	native libraries are already installed with Windows.
	
	
	For CURL:
	
	dll
	   |libcurlMT.lib
	   |libcurlMTd.lib
	   |libcurlMD.lib
	   |libcurlMD.dll
	   |libcurlMDd.lib
	   |libcurlMDd.dll
	include
	|curl
	lib
	   |libcurlMT.lib
	   |libcurlMTd.lib
	   |libcurlMD.lib
	   |libcurlMDd.lib
	
	
	For OpenSSL:
	
	dll
	   |libeay32MT.lib
	   |libeay32MTd.lib
	   |libeay32MD.lib
	   |libeay32MD.dll
	   |libeay32MDd.lib
	   |libeay32MDd.dll
	include
	|openssl
	lib
	   |libeay32MT.lib
	   |libeay32MTd.lib
	   |libeay32MD.lib
	   |libeay32MDd.lib
		
		
Build process
=====================================
	
	Below is the abstract structure of the project that describes the location
	of the source code, make files and output. Root directory contains top-level
	build scripts that are used to build KSI C API. After successful build out
	directory is created.
	
	
	|WinBuild32.bat
	|WinBuild62.bat
	|makefile
	|
	|src
	|  |ksi
	|	 | *.c
	|	 | *.h
	|	 | makefile
	|  |example
	|	 | *.c
	|	 | *.h      
	|	 | makefile
	|
	|test
	|  | *.c
	|  | *.h
	|  | makefile
	|   
	|out
	|  |lib
	|	 | *.lib
	|  |dll
	|	 | *.dll
	|  |bin
	|	 | *.exe	 
	|  |include
	|	 |ksi
	|		| *.h
		
	
Configuring build scripts
=====================================	

	For building process, above described top level-make file or 
	WinBuild32.bat/WinBuild64.bat must be called.
	
	Make file can be executed via CMD shell or Visual Studio command prompt shell.
	When using CMD shell environment must be configured using setenv command. 
	For example for 64-bit build setenv /x64.

	
	Make file has following options:
	
		1) DLL				- select if dll or lib is to be built. Default is lib. 	
		2) RTL				- select C run-time library (MT, MTd, MD, MDd).
							Default is MT. Note: MT and MTd can only be used with DLL=lib.
		3) NET_PROVIDER		- select the network provider. Possible values are:
							CURL, WININET and WINHTTP. When using CURL CURL_DIR
							must be specified. Default is CURL
		4) CRYPTO_PROVIDER	- select the cryptography provider for both hashing
							and PKI. Possible values are: OPENSSL and CRYPTOAPI.
							When using OPENSSL OPENSSL_DIR must be specified.
							Default is OPENSSL. 
		5) HASH_PROVIDER	- select the cryptography provider for hashing.
							Possible values are: OPENSSL and CRYPTOAPI. When
							using OPENSSL OPENSSL_DIR must be specified. Default
							is OPENSSL.
		6) TRUST_PROVIDER	- select the cryptography provider for PKI. Possible
							values are: OPENSSL and CRYPTOAPI. When using OPENSSL
							OPENSSL_DIR must be specified. Default is OPENSSL.
		3) CURL_DIR 		- Directory containing Curl library and include files.
		4) OPENSSL_DIR 		- Directory containing OpenSLL library and include
							files.
		5) OPENSSL_CA_FILE	- OPENSSL certificate file.
		6) OPENSSL_CA_DIR	- OPENSSL certificate directory.
		5) LDEXTRA 			- extra flags for linker.
		6) CCEXTRA 			- extra flags for compiler.

	
	Make file has following tasks:
	
		1) default		- build library using DLL and RTL option.
		2) all 			- build all libraries, examples and tests. RTL and DLL
						options are used when linking tests and examples.
		3) libraries	- build all libraries using every possible RTL options.
		4) libMT		- build static library linked against MT C RTL.
		5) libMTd		- build static library linked against MTd C RTL.
		6) libMD		- build static library linked against MD C RTL.
		7) libMDd		- build static library linked against MDd C RTL.
		8) dllMD		- build dynamic library linked against MD C RTL.
		9) dllMDd		- build dynamic library linked against MDd C RTL.
		10) example		- build examples. RTL and DLL options are used.
		11) tests		- build tests. RTL and DLL options are used.
		12) test 		- build and run tests. RTL and DLL options are used.
		13) clean		- clean the build.
