Build Targets
=============
  all      Builds the project without tests and example code.
  check    Builds the project, tests and example code.
  test     Executes all tests and generates test report xml.
  memtest  Executes all tests and generates valgrind report xml.
  coverage Executes all tests and generates coverage report xml.

Hashing with Common Crypto
==========================

As an experimental feature, it is possible to use the CommonCrypto library
for hash operations. Please note, this does not replace entirely the need
for OpenSSL, that will still be used for other cryptographic operations. To
enable this feature the flag --with-hash-provider=commoncrypto must be added
to the cofigure script.

OpenSSL Location
================

As of OSX 10.7 OpenSSL is no longer included in the OS. The easiest way to
install it is to use Homebrew. To build the SDK you need to specify where
OpenSSL is installed. Example:

    $ ./configure --with-openssl=/usr/local/opt/openssl/
